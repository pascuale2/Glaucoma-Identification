# Glaucoma-Identification
Optical Disc/Cup segmentation of retinal images using my implementation of UNet++. \
**This Repository is still a WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Model: UNet++ 
UNet++ adds on to the original UNet by adding: redesigned skip pathways, dense skip connections, and deep supervision. In this repository I have changed the UNet++ architecture a bit by adding residual connections and dropout layers 

## Dataset: REFUGE (from Grand-Challenge.org)
Contains Retinal Fundus images along with its corresponding mask segmenting the optic nerve head.
